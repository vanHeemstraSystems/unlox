## 100 - Where can I download Unlox for macOS?
Unlox for macOS can be downloaded directly from unlox.it/get

Please never download Unlox from anywhere other than the official site or the iOS App Store.

## 200 - How do I set up Unlox?
Setup is easy! Follow these steps and you'll be up and running in no time at all:

1. Install [Unlox for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1313188193?mt=8) and launch it.

2. Accept the permission prompt to allow Unlox to use Bluetooth.

3. Install [Unlox for macOS](https://unlox.it/get) and launch it.

4. When prompted, ensure you give Unlox for macOS permissions to use accessibility in System Settings > Privacy > Accessibility.
   
This is a **required step**, Unlox will not be able to enter your password otherwise.

6. Make sure **Unlox for iOS is running in the foreground**. Then in the Unlox for macOS setup window, select your device when it appears.
   
If it doesn't appear, check the troubleshooting steps below.

8. If you receive any Bluetooth pairing prompts from the system, you must accept them otherwise setup will fail!

9. The final step of setup is to tell Unlox what your macOS system password is, so that it can enter it for you on the Mac Lock Screen. Your password is encrypted and stored in the Keychain on your Mac.
Unlox for iOS never gets to see your password! **Unlox never connects to the internet without your consent**, and will only ever connect to the internet to check for updates or send crash reports.
